You may encounter some errors ⛔

1-You may not have installed one of the important books, so be sure to run the req.bat file once!
2-You may run the code but the buttons don't work, you must include the core section in your code!
3-The next error you may encounter is that you did not complete one of the sections I mentioned above (line 8) or they are incorrect!

Do you still have a problem?
